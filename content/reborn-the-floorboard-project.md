The MidiBox Project : [http://www.midibox.org](http://www.midibox.org/)

I'm actually in the phase of building a developpement prototype board
using redesigned standard modules and beginning to define what the final
hardware should look like.

Preliminary Specs
-----------------

-   Big alphanumeric or dot-matrix LED based display for song titles and
    patch number ...
-   Up and down bank buttons
-   A tap button for setting effect speed (essentially for delays)
-   10 preset buttons (rock solid !!!)
-   A LED per preset button indicating the active preset
-   10 to 20 parameters buttons (I don't know yet)
-   3 or 4 characters alphanumeric or dot-matrix LED displays for each
    parameter button indicating the function assigned (like
    REV/CHO/DLY/WHA ...)
-   Dual color LED per parameter button indicating the ON/OFF state
-   MIDI IN and OUT Tongue
-   2 to 4 relay-controlled jacks for amp channel switching
-   2 to 4 external controller inputs to connect standard guitar volume
    pedals controlling MIDI parameters (like Volume, WHA ... )
-   3 or 4 characters alphanumeric or dot-matrix LED displays for each
    external controller input indicating the function assigned
-   The software must be capable of sending multiple
    program-changes/control-changes/whatever on multiple channels on an
    input event
-   PC based user interface on a 1st step and a PIC based next
-   Maybe include a coffee machine (just kidding)
