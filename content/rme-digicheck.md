J'ai envoyé ce mail au support RME pour savoir s'il y avait un espoir de
voir un jour digicheck sur Linux :

Hi,

I'm an happy new user of an RME HDSP CardBus + Multiface and HDSP 9652.  
I mainly use the GNU/Linux OS (Currently the DeMuDi and Ubuntu  
distributions) and I was wondering if there is any hope to see someday
a  
Linux version of the DigiCheck software.  
This software is awesome and is the sole thing that I miss to have a  
complete delighting experience with Free Software.  
I would prefer an open sourced version but even a precompiled closed  
source tool would be great (since I think you have put great knowledge  
in this piece of software and I can understand you don't want to see
any  
other manufacturer use your work freely) or a mix of both with closed  
source librairies and open sourced free GUI ala nVidia.

You have the power to fulfill my dream!  
Any hopes?

Thanks  
Raphaël Doursenaud.

No, sorry, that is not likely to happen...

Dommage, j'espère vraiment qu'un jour ils changeront d'avis...
